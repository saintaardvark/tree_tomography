* What times do I expect?
For my test setup (~47 cm): something like 470-570 ms
- Assume pine -- softwood
- 47 cm * 10 == 470ms
- 47 cm * 12 == 564

- Speed of sound ("stress wave transit times")
  - Hardwood: 7-9 microseconds/cm
  - Softwood: 10-12 microseconds/cm
- So nominal 30cm trunk diameter: 210-360 microseconds
- which means needing something like 5 Mhz


* Setting another pin for I2C
- ESP32 can set any pin for i2c, as long as it's not in use by another function

  #+begin_src c++
    // These are open in the WeMos Lolin32Lite

    #include <Wire.h>

    #define I2C_SDA 23
    #define I2C_SCL 19

    Wire.begin(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);
  #+end_src

- Pick pin for digital (?) interrupt
- Test with button push
- Break out to more foil, alligator clip
- Test w/hammer hit
* DONE Interrupt for mpu6050?

  - which refers to the jrowberg/ic2devlib library, though more about
    polling
* TODO Interrupt reset for mpu6050
- Currently I have to power cycle the esp32 to get another interrupt
  to work. I'm assuming there's a reset I can do on the mpu itself --
  probably something that's currently in the init routine for the mpu.
* TODO Fix hammer timing
* TODO Break out threshold calculation to its own function
* TODO Consistify snake_case / camelCase varnames
