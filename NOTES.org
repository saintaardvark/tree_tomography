* What times do I expect?
For my test setup (~47 cm): something like 470-570 ms
- Assume pine -- softwood
- 47 cm * 10 == 470ms
- 47 cm * 12 == 564

- Speed of sound ("stress wave transit times")
  - Hardwood: 7-9 microseconds/cm
  - Softwood: 10-12 microseconds/cm
- So nominal 30cm trunk diameter: 210-360 microseconds
- which means needing something like 5 Mhz
- Also: see docs fole

* Setting another pin for I2C
- ESP32 can set any pin for i2c, as long as it's not in use by another function

  #+begin_src c++
    // These are open in the WeMos Lolin32Lite

    #include <Wire.h>

    #define I2C_SDA 23
    #define I2C_SCL 19

    Wire.begin(I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL);
  #+end_src

- Pick pin for digital (?) interrupt
- Test with button push
- Break out to more foil, alligator clip
- Test w/hammer hit

* TODO Consistify snake_case / camelCase varnames
* TODO Interrupt reset for mpu6050
- Currently I have to power cycle the esp32 to get another interrupt
  to work. I'm assuming there's a reset I can do on the mpu itself --
  probably something that's currently in the init routine for the mpu.

- https://codeandlife.com/2012/07/03/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-gpio-speed/
  - 22MHz w/Pi -- so ~ 45 ns/pulse
  - though this is for *sending* signals w/gpio on pi
