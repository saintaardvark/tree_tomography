Using log for first time.  Sensor at top and bottom, both sides.

Using hammer by holding it on side A by hand, sensor 1 -- travel time to sensor 2.

Have marked places where feet of hammer can be put so that we can try to get consistent measurements.

# First running

Sensor 1 to Sensor 2

2023-12-17_14:16:15.csv -- first run, no holes. 
2023-12-17_14:18:30.csv -- second run, no holes

Sensor 2 to Sensor 1

2023-12-17_14:24:06.csv -- first run, no holes
2023-12-17_14:25:33.csv -- second run,no holes.  Removed 4 outliers (hundreds of thousands of microseconds)

# Second run

one hole, 3.25" deep, middle

Sensor 1 to Sensor 2

2023-12-17_14:40:22.csv -- first run, one hole
2023-12-17_14:41:43.csv -- second run, one hole

Sensor 2 to Sensor 1

2023-12-17_14:43:41.csv -- first run, one hole; removed one outlier at start
2023-12-17_14:45:00.csv -- second run, one hole

Hole 1" across.  Radius of whole log is 6".  Hole is approx in middle -- so call it a 1.67% increase in difference

Going to drill 2 more holes to make larger diff -- figure should be pprox 11.6% further, which hoepfully will show up with larger time of flight values.
