# README

It has been a while since I've worked on this.  This is code currently
running on the pico that's hooked up to 8 vibration sensors; if I'm
remembering things & reading the output correctly, it appears to be
reading everything at once and printing out timing information for
everything as expected.

I'm unable to find where I might have written this code down, so I'm
copying this into this branch to preserve it before it gets lost.
