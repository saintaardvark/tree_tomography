# This is a little bit different from main.py:
#
# - this post comes from the thread & the original author, whereas
#   main.py comes from J. Beale's github repo.
#
# - But also, this code was corrected by the original author (set vs
#   mov), and those changes don't seem to have been captured in the
#   github repo.
#
# - finally, the simulated signals are in here too.
